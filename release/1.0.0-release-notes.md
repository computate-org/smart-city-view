# 1.0.0 Mon Oct 24, 2022: Initial Release! 

This 1.0.0 marks the first official version of the Smarta Byar Smart Village project. 
It's a collaboration between Boston University research students, 
the Red Hat Social Innovation Program combined with the Red Hat Research Team, 
Smarta Byar organization providing Smart Technology Sensors in our live test village in Veber√∂d Sweden, 
and FIWARE providing the standards and NGSI-LD compliant context broker for IOT data. 

This version has models for IOT Nodes and Traffic Simulations which allow us to simulate people, vehicles, and traffic lights on roads and animate them over time. 
We use both simulated traffic data provided by the open source software called SUMO, as well as live data from the village.
