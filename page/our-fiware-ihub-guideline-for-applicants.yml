IHUB_NAME: Smarta Byar Smart Village Community
IHUB_DESCRIPTION: |
  The Red Hat Global Social Innovation Program is partnering with Boston University and Smarta Byar in order to create a global and open research platform. 
  This will allow researchers to study what social sustainability means by using a digital twin of Veberöd, Sweden as the test village, supported by  Smarta Byar. 
  We have added integration with the Orion LD Context Broker supported by FIWARE technology implementing their Smart Data Models to align ourselves with the rest of the open source smart solution community. 
  The goal of this collaboration is to build the open source technological infrastructure so that researchers can collaborate on this platform effectively to study mobility, public health, sustainability among other study areas to ultimately help define better the link between well being and eco-smart cities.

IHUB_WHY: >
  We learned about the FIWARE Marketplace and the strong community of FIWARE Innovation Hubs and partners while attending the FIWARE Summit. 
  Building with the FIWARE context broker means that we can combine our data with the rest of the FIWARE Marketplace applications to discover new ways to visualize our data. 
  FIWARE's Smart Data Models align with our smart solutions as well, and the FIWARE Context Broker supports all of these data models, which is why our project is now powered by a FIWARE Context Broker. 
IHUB_REGIONAL_CONNECTION_TO_PUBLIC_AUTHORITIES: >
  We have connections with the Boston Mayor’s Office for New Urban Dynamics. 
  But right now our mission is focused on Veberöd, Sweden, where we obviously have lots of connections through Jan Malmgren and [our project partner SmartaByar](https://sensative.com/iot_use_cases/smart-villages-customer-use-case/).
IHUB_REGIONAL_DEMANDS: >
  Once our platform is ready for outside users, 
  our plan is to inform our Boston contacts and ask them to test it and provide feedback.

IHUB_FIWARE_EXPERIENCE: |
  - We developed the open source [Smart Village Operator](https://github.com/computate-org/smartvillage-operator/) which runs on Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes. 
    It currently implements the TrafficFlowObserved smart data model as a Kubernetes custom resource definition with more to come. 
    It's compatible with any Smart Data Model, and easy to extend with new Smart Data Models we have not implemented yet. 
    It registers the smart data model as a service group on the IOT Agent JSON, and individual devices for each instance of the Smart Data Model custom resource definition you define. 
  - We developed the [GitOps to deploy the FIWARE IoT Agent JSON](https://github.com/computate-org/smartabyar-smartvillage/tree/main/openshift/kustomize/bundles/iotagent-json) to Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes. 
  - We developed the [GitOps to deploy the FIWARE IoT Agent UL](https://github.com/computate-org/smartabyar-smartvillage/tree/main/openshift/kustomize/bundles/iotagent-ul) to Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes. 
  - We helped with the development and documentation of the [FIWARE Local Marinera development environment on Red Hat OpenShift Local](https://github.com/FIWARE-Ops/marinera/blob/main/documentation/LOCAL_MARINERA.md). 
  - We developed two reusable [FIWARE Hackathons on GitHub for Smart Cities](https://github.com/orgs/rh-impact/projects/6/views/1) and [Smart Environment](https://github.com/orgs/rh-impact/projects/5/views/1). 
  - We have open sourced the working architecture for deploying [FIWARE components to the New England Research Cloud OpenShift environment in production](https://github.com/computate-org/smartabyar-smartvillage/tree/main/openshift/kustomize/bundles/fiware). 
  - We have presented several sessions at the FIWARE Summit 2022 in Gran Canaria, Spain. 
  - We will be  presenting several more sessions at the FIWARE Summit 2023 in Vienna, Austria.

                  A FIWARE iHub is the center for the adoption of FIWARE technologies among businesses in a given region. 
                  iHubs address the traditional barriers for business expansion of SMEs, mid-caps and large companies, improving accessibility to their target markets. 
                  They increase competitiveness through modernization and, at a regional level, facilitate the diversification of the local economy.

                  FIWARE iHubs are classified by the services they provide, by the resources they allocate and by other factors. 
                  They have to be operated by organizations which are members of the FIWARE Foundation. 
                  There are four categories of FIWARE iHubs, starting with the lowest category, named ‘Basic’, where up to three stars can be gained, as services and resources are growing. 
                  Different kinds of FIWARE iHubs can be approved, depending on their characteristics. 
                  The FIWARE iHubs Committee, with the support of the FIWARE Foundation, has the responsibility of assessing the performance of existing or new FIWARE iHub candidates with respect to defined FIWARE iHubs levels and facilitating the overall coordination and collaboration of FIWARE iHubs.

                  Your FIWARE iHub is devoted to instructing and educating, but also helping and advising local communities, matching the demands of their local market and creating new demands.
                  Applicants must carry out such tasks through a strong multidisciplinary team, with relevant experience in similar activities. 
                  Among other criteria, it is necessary that iHub staff demonstrate abilities in technology counseling, using FIWARE technology. 
                  iHubs need to demonstrate that they have – or are planning to have – resources to provide such services.

                  If you are running as an iHub before the application process, you have developed some activities. 
                  In that case, you can apply to be an established iHub. 
                  According to activities you already performed during the year before the application date, you will obtain a specific level (Basic, Standard/1 star, Advanced/2 stars or Premium/3 stars).

                  In case you have not started running your activity as an iHub yet, you can apply to be an incubated iHub. 
                  You need to provide an Action Plan for the next year. 
                  Both cases, you need to provide resource evidence.

                              Christopher Tate from Red Hat, professor Christos Cassandras, students at Boston University, and CTO of FIWARE, Juanjo Hierro, met together at Boston University Campus to discuss a new FIWARE Innovation Hub. 
                              A FIWARE iHub, gravitating around university activities, is a good basis for creating an ecosystem, training, and research for the concept of smart cities. 
                              We all agreed on the benefits of building a FIWARE iHub, supporting the use of FIWARE technologies, together between Boston University and Red Hat.

                              Thursday Feb 2, 2023, in both North America and Europe, we hosted a Red Hat Impact Hackathon in partnership with FIWARE. 
                              The hackathon in North America unfortunately was cancelled due to freezing rain in Dallas Texas at that time, but the EMEA hackathon was a success! 
                              Participants used your technical and non-technical skills to contribute in teams of 4 to socially impactful Smart Data Models. 
                              They worked as teams to run OpenShift Local on your own laptop, deploy FIWARE applications into OpenShift, import Smart Data Model data, and visualize the data in your team's own creative ways. 
                              They learned how FIWARE open standards and open APIs around Smart Solutions are making a huge impact in the world.

                                  We learned some valuable insights on how to improve the deployment of the FIWARE Context Broker and related components on OpenShift. 
                                  We found that the 6 Apple computers with M1 ARM computers had trouble deploying ArgoCD on OpenShift, which is valuable feedback to the developers of the GitOps Operator. 
                                  We also learned it's more useful as a 2 day event, so that participants have more time to digest the information and create results. 
                                  It's important not to let the hackathon compete with other technical sessions that the participants want to join. 
                                  There can be little issues with the wifi bandwidth downloading CRC and images, and it's better to prepare the environment before the hackathon. 
                                  We should focus  more on Edge Tech, IOT Agent, MicroShift, to make it more interesting.

                              The village of Veberöd, Sweden is a global research test village powered by Sensative, Yggio, and FIWARE based technology.
                              It's a very small village of 5,000, started in 2008 as a local communication platform.
                              in 2018, Smarta Byar started as an IoT platform as a balance to smart cities in rural areas for many IoT projects: 
                              
                              - water sensors for water bins for cow herds
                              - medicine delivery with drones 
                              - smart trees 
                              - bicycle tracking 
                              - water quality monitoring
                              - doctors in augmented reality for rural areas
                              - smart lamp posts

                              Jan Malmgren, the founder of Smarta Byar works with IoT technology to make the lives of residents of the village happier.

                                  Started in March 2022, Red Hat Global Social Innovation Program is partnering with Boston University and Smarta Byar in order to collaborate on creating a global and open research platform allowing researchers to study what social sustainability means by using a digital twin of Veberöd, Sweden as the test village, supported by Smarta Byar. 
                                  Today, we have successfully created animated traffic simulations that run in the cloud, available from any browser. 
                                  The platform also has configurable traffic simulation reports, including graphs and data tables that show live performance changes as simulations are run event-driven in the background. 
                                  It is based on the latest FIWARE standards for TrafficFlowObserved and CrowdFlowObserved Smart Data Models. 
                                  It integrates with the Orion-LD Context Broker for subscribing to smart device context updates.

                                  The Smart Village Operator is a greatly simplified way to deploy all the components of the Smarta Byar Smart Village platform, including FIWARE components like the IoT Agent JSON and Orion-LD COntext Broker. 
                                  The operator already includes Custom Resource Definitions for the latest FIWARE standards for TrafficFlowObserved and CrowdFlowObserved Smart Data Models. 
                                  It has an automated way to easily add any of the other Smart Data Models as new Custom Resource Definitions in the operator. 
                                  There are Custom Resource Definitions for configuring the Orion-LD Context Broker and IoT Agent JSON. 
                                  It automatically configures service groups and devices for each smart data model with the IoT Agent and Orion-LD Context Broker for subscribing to start receiving smart device context updates through MQTT or AMQP protocols. 
                                  The Orion-LD Context Broker automatically creates a subscription for each device that is published to the Smarta Byar Smart Village application for receiving context updates from devices where they can be used.

                              CISE activities are designed to catalyze and support cross-disciplinary faculty research collaborations, advance scientific understanding and discovery, 
                              facilitate engagement with industry, and support a diverse community of faculty and students. 
                              In conjunction with this core mission, CISE spearheads a number of activities to project the College of Engineering’s and BU’s strength in information 
                              and systems engineering, both internally within BU, and externally.

                                  A reusable banner for placing outside of a FIWARE Hackathon to draw people to participate at an in-person event. 
                                  It worked quite well leading up to the FIWARE Hackathon for the Red Hat Tech Exchange in Dallas. 
                                  I talked to many people that day about FIWARE and they learned a lot. 
                                  Unfortunately the Dallas hackathon was cancelled because of an ice storm that came through the area. 
                                  But the sign was very effective at promoting FIWARE technology at Red Hat.

                                  The official FIWARE Smart Cities Reference Architecture flyers. 
                                  It also includes the page about "System of Systems Approach for a Smart City Reference Architecture". 
                                  It worked quite well leading up to the FIWARE Hackathon for the Red Hat Tech Exchange in Dallas. 
                                  I talked to many people that day about FIWARE and shared some of these flyers, and they learned a lot.

                              After June 2023, we will enhance our existing hackathon with the latest FIWARE and Red Hat Technology. 
                              This will include new instructions on the deployment of an IOT Agent. 
                              It will also involve more event driven messaging. 
                              We plan on delivering a future hackathon at a future FIWARE Summit. 
                              We also plan on delivering a future hackathon at a future North America Red Hat Tech Exchange.
