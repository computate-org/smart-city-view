IHUB_NAME: Smarta Byar Smart Village Community
IHUB_DESCRIPTION: |
  The Red Hat Global Social Innovation Program is partnering with Boston University and Smarta Byar in order to create a global and open research platform. 
  This will allow researchers to study what social sustainability means by using a digital twin of Veber√∂d, Sweden as the test village, supported by  Smarta Byar. 
  We have added integration with the Orion LD Context Broker supported by FIWARE technology implementing their Smart Data Models to align ourselves with the rest of the open source smart solution community. 
  The goal of this collaboration is to build the open source technological infrastructure so that researchers can collaborate on this platform effectively to study mobility, public health, sustainability among other study areas to ultimately help define better the link between well being and eco-smart cities.

IHUB_WHY: |
  We learned about the FIWARE Marketplace and the strong community of FIWARE Innovation Hubs and partners while attending the FIWARE Summit. 
  Building with the FIWARE context broker means that we can combine our data with the rest of the FIWARE Marketplace applications to discover new ways to visualize our data. 
  FIWARE's Smart Data Models align with our smart solutions as well, and the FIWARE Context Broker supports all of these data models, which is why our project is now powered by a FIWARE Context Broker.

IHUB_FIWARE_EXPERIENCE: |
  - We developed the open source [Smart Village Operator](https://github.com/computate-org/smartvillage-operator/) which runs on Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes. 
    It currently implements the TrafficFlowObserved smart data model as a Kubernetes custom resource definition with more to come. 
    It's compatible with any Smart Data Model, and easy to extend with new Smart Data Models we have not implemented yet. 
    It registers the smart data model as a service group on the IOT Agent JSON, and individual devices for each instance of the Smart Data Model custom resource definition you define. 
  - We developed the [GitOps to deploy the FIWARE IoT Agent JSON](https://github.com/computate-org/smartabyar-smartvillage/tree/main/openshift/kustomize/bundles/iotagent-json) to Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes. 
  - We developed the [GitOps to deploy the FIWARE IoT Agent UL](https://github.com/computate-org/smartabyar-smartvillage/tree/main/openshift/kustomize/bundles/iotagent-ul) to Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes. 
  - We helped with the development and documentation of the [FIWARE Local Marinera development environment on Red Hat OpenShift Local](https://github.com/FIWARE-Ops/marinera/blob/main/documentation/LOCAL_MARINERA.md). 
  - We developed two reusable [FIWARE Hackathons on GitHub for Smart Cities](https://github.com/orgs/rh-impact/projects/6/views/1) and [Smart Environment](https://github.com/orgs/rh-impact/projects/5/views/1). 
  - We have open sourced the working architecture for deploying [FIWARE components to the New England Research Cloud OpenShift environment in production](https://github.com/computate-org/smartabyar-smartvillage/tree/main/openshift/kustomize/bundles/fiware). 
  - We have presented several sessions at the FIWARE Summit 2022 in Gran Canaria, Spain. 
  - We will be  presenting several more sessions at the FIWARE Summit 2023 in Vienna, Austria.

                  A FIWARE iHub is the center for the adoption of FIWARE technologies among businesses in a given region. 
                  iHubs address the traditional barriers for business expansion of SMEs, mid-caps and large companies, improving accessibility to their target markets. 
                  They increase competitiveness through modernization and, at a regional level, facilitate the diversification of the local economy.

                  A FIWARE iHub offers several services to local companies, including technology and consulting support, training, research and testing, all using FIWARE technology. 
                  It brings them support to join the FIWARE Marketplace.

                  FIWARE iHubs are classified by the services they provide, by the resources they allocate and by other factors. 
                  They have to be operated by organizations which are members of the FIWARE Foundation. 
                  There are four categories of FIWARE iHubs, starting with the lowest category, named ‚ÄòBasic‚Äô, where up to three stars can be gained, as services and resources are growing. 
                  Different kinds of FIWARE iHubs can be approved, depending on their characteristics. 
                  The FIWARE iHubs Committee, with the support of the FIWARE Foundation, has the responsibility of assessing the performance of existing or new FIWARE iHub candidates with respect to defined FIWARE iHubs levels and facilitating the overall coordination and collaboration of FIWARE iHubs.

                  Your FIWARE iHub is devoted to instructing and educating, but also helping and advising local communities, matching the demands of their local market and creating new demands.
                  Applicants must carry out such tasks through a strong multidisciplinary team, with relevant experience in similar activities. 
                  Among other criteria, it is necessary that iHub staff demonstrate abilities in technology counseling, using FIWARE technology. 
                  iHubs need to demonstrate that they have ‚Äì or are planning to have ‚Äì resources to provide such services.

                  If you are running as an iHub before the application process, you have developed some activities. 
                  In that case, you can apply to be an established iHub. 
                  According to activities you already performed during the year before the application date, you will obtain a specific level (Basic, Standard/1 star, Advanced/2 stars or Premium/3 stars).

                              Christopher Tate from Red Hat, together our professor and students at Boston University, and Juanjo CTO of FIWARE met together at Boston University Campus to discuss a new FIWARE Innovation Hub. 
                              A FIWARE iHub, gravitating around university activities, is a good basis for creating an ecosystem, training, and research for the concept of smart cities. 
                              We all agreed on the benefits of building a FIWARE iHub, supporting the use of FIWARE technologies, together between Boston University and Red Hat.

                              Thursday Feb 2, 2022, in both North America and Europe, we hosted a Red Hat Impact Hackathon in partnership with FIWARE. 
                              The hackathon in North America unfortunately was cancelled due to freezing rain in Dallas Texas at that time, but the EMEA hackathon was a success! 
                              Participants used your technical and non-technical skills to contribute in teams of 4 to socially impactful Smart Data Models. 
                              They worked as teams to run OpenShift Local on your own laptop, deploy FIWARE applications into OpenShift, import Smart Data Model data, and visualize the data in your team's own creative ways. 
                              They learned how FIWARE open standards and open APIs around Smart Solutions are making a huge impact in the world.

                                  We learned some valuable insights on how to improve the deployment of the FIWARE Context Broker and related components on OpenShift. 
                                  We found that the 6 Apple computers with M1 ARM computers had trouble deploying ArgoCD on OpenShift, which is valuable feedback to the developers of the GitOps Operator. 
                                  We also learned it's more useful as a 2 day event, so that participants have more time to digest the information and create results. 
                                  It's important not to let the hackathon compete with other technical sessions that the participants want to join. 
                                  There can be little issues with the wifi bandwidth downloading CRC and images, and it's better to prepare the environment before the hackathon. 
                                  We should focus  more on Edge Tech, IOT Agent, MicroShift, to make it more interesting.

                                  A reusable banner for placing outside of a FIWARE Hackathon to draw people to participate at an in-person event. 
                                  It worked quite well leading up to the FIWARE Hackathon for the Red Hat Tech Exchange in Dallas. 
                                  I talked to many people that day about FIWARE and they learned a lot. 
                                  Unfortunately the Dallas hackathon was cancelled because of an ice storm that came through the area. 
                                  But the sign was very effective at promoting FIWARE technology at Red Hat.

                              It will also automatically register individual devices for each CrowdFlowObserved custom resource definition created. 
                              This also integrates the device with our Smarta Byar Smart Village application to complete the integration with FIWARE components.
