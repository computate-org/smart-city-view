      Are you wondering, how do I pick an operating system to develop my website? Between Windows, Mac and many versions of Linux, which one is the most stable, helpful and secure? 
      Hello, my name is {{ author.name }}. 
      I am a Red Hat {{ author.title }} and I love open source software. 
      I've tried many operating systems over the years. 
      After switching to linux a decade ago, I've tried many Linux distros. 
      In terms of stability, usefulness and security, I will always choose {{ os.name }}, and I'll help you get started on {{ os.name }} too.
